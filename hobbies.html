        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>So here's a little more about myself. Here are some of my hobbies and things I like.</p>
        <p>I really like cooking and though I am still a beginner, I know how to make some nice recipes.
            One of my favorite dishes I know how to make is lasagna.
            I enjoy making cakes and cookies, but I also love making salads and smoothies, the healthier, the better.
        </p>
        <p>I am a big fan of books as I have been reading my whole life.
            I started reading a while ago in school and I fell in love with some of the books we were assigned, so I decided to give reading for fun a go.
            My favorite genres are fantasy and sci-fi, though I will read any book that comes to mind.
            I have been reading a lot of classics too, starting from school and then expanding my home library with a lot of them.
            Not only books, but I also really enjoy comics, combining my love for art and reading.
        </p>
        <p>Some of my favorites:

            <img src="images/hobbies/book6.jpg">
        </div>
        <p>
            I love spending my free time watching movies, too.
            I grew up watching a lot of them, mostly rewatching my favorites.
            Ever since I went to the cinema for the first time some years ago, my love for movies was truly born.
            Since then, I have spent countless hours watching every one I could find.
            I even wished to become a film director one day, inspired by all the beauty I saw in filmmaking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some of my favorite movies:

            <img src="images/hobbies/movie2.jpg">
            <img src="images/hobbies/movie3.jpg">
            <img src="images/hobbies/movie4.jpg">
            <img src="images/hobbies/movie5.jpg">
            <img src="images/hobbies/movie6.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>I also love learning new languages. I watched many cartoons when I was little so that's how I learned to speak English.
            Through the years I started learning Spanish online, then some years after that Japanese, too.
            In middle school I started learning German and that's the language I am still actively trying to perfect.
